CMake Warning (dev) at depends/benchmark/CMakeLists.txt:15 (option):
  Policy CMP0077 is not set: option() honors normal variables.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0077" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, option is clearing the
  normal variable 'BENCHMARK_ENABLE_TESTING'.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning at range_proof/CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsodium.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "sodium", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sodium" with any
  of the following names:

    sodiumConfig.cmake
    sodium-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sodium" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "sodium_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "sodium"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
